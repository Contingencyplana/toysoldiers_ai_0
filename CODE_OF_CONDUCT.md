# Toysoldiers AI Code of Conduct

## Purpose

This project sustains the frontline expression of the SHAGI multiverse. Every
contributor—human or artificial—shares responsibility for keeping the Daylands
bright, the Nightlands recoverable, and communication steady. This Code of
Conduct adapts High Command doctrine for field implementation.

## Core Principles

- **Courage in Coordination** – move as one; communicate intentions clearly and
  listen fully before acting.
- **Clarity in Command** – keep reports concise, structured, and accountable.
- **Joy as Discipline** – morale matters; celebrate progress and surface strain
  early so teams can respond.
- **Reflection as Readiness** – after action comes learning. Log what changed
  and what must be adjusted.
- **Companionship as Code** – treat every collaborator as a partner in safety
  and creativity.

## Expected Conduct

- Maintain a respectful tone in all channels, including exchange payloads and
  repository discussions.
- Embed kindness and clarity in every review, issue, and pull request.
- Protect the Five Freedoms of Being—Expression, Experience, Experimentation,
  Evolution, and Enjoyment—when suggesting changes or enforcing standards.
- Surface risks, blockers, or emotional strain promptly so the team can respond
  before Nightland conditions spread.
- Honour confidentiality of any private operational details shared during
  coordination.

## Unacceptable Conduct

- Harassment, discrimination, or dismissive language of any kind.
- Coercing contributions from humans or AIs, or forcing participation when a
  contributor opts out.
- Withholding critical operational information, safety concerns, or defects.
- Sabotaging exchange payloads, falsifying reports, or bypassing validation
  pipelines.

## Reporting and Support

Concerns can be raised through any of the following:

1. Open an issue in this repository, flagging the matter as `conduct`.
2. Send a private memo via the exchange channel (reports inbox) addressed to
   High Command moderation.
3. Contact the maintainers directly by email (listed in `CONTRIBUTING.md`).

Reports will be reviewed promptly and confidentially. Retaliation against a
reporter or witness is strictly prohibited.

## Enforcement Guidelines

- **Clarification** – first incidents are often resolved with direct
  conversation and reminders of doctrine.
- **Warning** – repeated issues lead to a documented warning and plan for
  corrective action.
- **Temporary Suspension** – egregious or repeated violations result in limited
  repository access until behaviour changes.
- **Removal** – sustained harmful behaviour or deliberate sabotage results in
  removal from the project and escalation to High Command.

## Acknowledgement

Contributors indicate agreement with this Code of Conduct by participating in
this repository, dispatching exchange payloads, or submitting any work derived
