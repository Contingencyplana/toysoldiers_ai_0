# Field Operations Theater Structure

## Overview

The golf folders (golf_00 through golf_15) represent our 16 primary field operations theaters, each powered by AI Labscapes and organized through the 16×16 emoji battlegrid system. Each theater contains 16 delta sectors that manage specific tactical domains.

## Theater Layout

### Golf Theater Structure
Each golf folder represents a complete field operations theater:
- 256 operational nodes (16×16 grid)
- Direct integration with AI Labscapes
- Real-time tactical execution capability
- Field intelligence processing

### Delta Sector Assignments

| Delta | Tactical Domain | Operational Focus |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| delta_00 | Command & Control | Central battlefield coordination |
| delta_01 | Intelligence Processing | Real-time data analysis |
| delta_02 | Resource Management | AI resource optimization |
| delta_03 | Communications | Inter-theater coordination |
| delta_04 | Tactical Execution | Mission implementation |
| delta_05 | Performance Analytics | Operational metrics |
| delta_06 | Security Operations | Field security protocols |
| delta_07 | Emergency Response | Rapid intervention systems |
| delta_08 | AI Integration | Labscape coordination |
| delta_09 | Interface Control | Battlegrid management |
| delta_10 | Infrastructure | Operational support |
| delta_11 | Training & Simulation | Field readiness |
| delta_12 | External Operations | Cross-theater operations |
| delta_13 | Standards & Protocols | Field protocols |
| delta_14 | Crisis Management | Emergency protocols |
| delta_15 | Analysis & Reporting | Intelligence synthesis |

## Operational Flow

1. Command flows from High Command through golf theaters
2. Each delta sector processes its tactical domain
3. AI Labscapes power decision-making and execution
4. 16×16 emoji battlegrids provide operational interface
5. Field intelligence flows back up through the chain
