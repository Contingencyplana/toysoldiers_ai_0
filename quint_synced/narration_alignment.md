# Narration Alignment Brief

## Reference Line

- Stub captured from spike: `"Forge crafts the Ally → Victory"`
- Glyph chain: `🛠️` `⚒️` `🤖` `✅`

## Current Lore Hooks

- Ritual: Forge crafts allied automata that secure victory.
- Outcome emphasis: highlight triumphant resolution without revealing classified tactics.
- Chain cadence: four beats; recommend VO pacing `Forge` (beat) `crafts` (beat) `the Ally` (beat) `leads to Victory`.

## Pronunciation and Delivery

- `Forge`: hard "g"; evoke industrial resonance.
- `Ally`: stress first syllable; friendly tone.
- Arrow glyph (`→`): read as "leads to" rather than "arrow".
- Overall tone: authoritative but celebratory; default narrator persona is War Office herald unless overruled.

## Glyph-to-VO Guidance

- `🛠️` (forge sigil): cue metallic strike sound underlay.
- `⚒️`: reinforce forging action; brief dual-hit Foley.
- `🤖`: articulate "Ally" with slight mechanized filter.
- `✅`: resolve with upward inflection signaling mission success.

## Open Questions for War Office

- Confirm narrator persona (War Office herald vs frontline correspondent).
- Define fallback language if narration must be localized (list priority locales).
- Approve background ambience palette (industrial forge, marching cadence, silent).
- Provide guidance on handling longer chains and repeated glyph sequences.
- Clarify whether VO should mirror `summary` text verbatim or allow adaptive storytelling.

## Session Preparation Notes

- Share this brief alongside `attachments/guides/payload_alignment.md` before the meeting.
- Capture decisions + pronunciation rulings in repo (update this doc or append `narration_alignment.md` changelog).
- Request War Office to supply draft VO script + pronunciation key by agreed deadline after session.
