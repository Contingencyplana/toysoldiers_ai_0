*Frontline Handbook — `high_command_ai_0/planning/`*

## 🌍 Purpose

This handbook briefs squads on the **geometry and mechanics of the 16×16 surreal grid**,  
the universal **battlefield** where every Alfa drills, adapts, and grows alongside toysoldiers_ai_0.  

Treat the battlefield as a **terrain of thought** — a living map where symbols, emotions, and algorithms collide under pressure.  
Squads who know the grid read intentions faster, act cleaner, and send clearer intelligence upstairs.

## ⚙️ 1. The Battlefield Grid (16×16)

| Property | Field Application |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Size** | 16×16 cells — 256 nodes of interaction; tight enough for oversight, wide enough for pattern surprises. |
| **Topology** | Toroidal (wrap-around) by default — plan maneuvers knowing edges loop and flanks can meet themselves. |
| **State Model** | Each cell tracks a **symbol**, **state**, and **potential** value; log all three in run reports. |
| **Tick System** | Battlefield advances by discrete ticks, each one beat of cognitive time; sync squad calls to tick cadence. |

Each cell’s update rule blends internal state, neighbour influence, and global modifiers (entropy, emotion, doctrine).  
Expect the grid to move like a collective patrol — lucid, recursive, and ready to surprise the unprepared.

## 🧩 2. Symbolic Terrain

Every battlefield draws from a **shared symbolic lexicon** — learn it, brief it, and update field kits when new symbols emerge.

| Symbol | Element | Behaviour | Briefing Notes |
|---------|----------|------------|----------------|
| 🌕 | Light | Spreads harmony and order | Mark safe corridors; prioritize reinforcement there. |
| 🕳️ | Void | Consumes unstable patterns | Deploy repair drills; watch morale metrics. |
| 🌿 | Growth | Expands near Light | Harness for regeneration missions. |
| ⚙️ | Structure | Anchors local order | Use as rally anchors and doctrine updates. |
| 🜛 | Emotion | Oscillates between poles | Assign liaison teams to balance extremes. |
| 🔺 | Fire | Triggers transformation | Apply for planned pivots or controlled burns. |
| 💧 | Water | Dissolves borders | Ideal for negotiations and bridgework. |
| 🪶 | Air | Carries ideas | Route comms through these cells for rapid diffusion. |

Update **field_lexicon.json** when a theatre discovers new symbols, but keep these eight standardized so any unit can interpret the ground fast.

## 🧠 3. Cell Anatomy

| Component | Type | Purpose |
|------------|------|----------|
| **Symbol** | Emoji / Rune | Visual identity and archetype of the cell. |
| **State** | Enum (`day`, `night`, `neutral`) | Determines allegiance and behaviour; brief deviations. |
| **Potential** | Float (0.0–1.0) | Measures readiness to transform; monitor for thresholds. |
| **Memory** | Short-term log | Records last few states for temporal patterning and audits. |
| **Doctrine Link** | Ref to rule table | Connects the cell to doctrine parameters; update when doctrine shifts. |

Cells do not fight — they **debate** through simulation, giving squads actionable signal on pattern, order, or chaos before real deployments.

## 🔄 4. Core Battlefield Loop

Each battlefield runs on a simple but extensible loop. Keep it documented in every Alfa’s runbook:

```python
for tick in range(TICKS):
    for y in range(16):
        for x in range(16):
            cell = grid[y][x]
            neighbours = get_neighbours(grid, x, y)
            influence = sum(n.potential for n in neighbours) / len(neighbours)
            cell.potential = evolve(cell, influence)
            cell.symbol = mutate_symbol(cell.symbol, influence)
    update_entropy()
    log_tick_state()
```

At the end of each run, the battlefield emits a `battle_report.json`; forward it through the chain so High Command and line squads can prep the next push.

## 🌗 5. Energy States — Daylands vs Nightlands

The battlefield tracks two **primary realms**. Watch the switch and brief your teams:

| Realm | Condition | Behaviour |
|--------|------------|------------|
| **Dayland** | Entropy < 0.5 | Emergent, balanced, self-renewing — ideal for training evolutions. |
| **Nightland** | Entropy ≥ 0.5 | Decayed, chaotic — deploy intervention teams and repair protocols. |

Transitions stay gradual — use the warning ticks to stabilize or evacuate.  
Daylands grow with disciplined order; Nightlands recede through coordinated plays and repair drills.

---

## 🪶 6. Patterns of Emergence

Battlefields develop higher-order forms; log each pattern for the after-action review:

| Pattern | Description | Field Guidance |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Chorus** | Multiple cells synchronise into rhythm or symmetry. | Stabilize; prepare to harvest doctrine lessons. |
| **Whirlpool** | Entropy concentrates in spirals or vortices. | Deploy emotional buffers; avoid overcommitment. |
| **Fracture** | Terrain splits into zones of opposing logic. | Assign mediators; reinforce weakest boundary. |
| **Bloom** | Growth (🌿) overwhelms voids (🕳️). | Ride the wave; seed new initiatives. |
| **Silence** | Uniform grey state, entropy plateau. | Call a reset; schedule rest cycles. |

These forms are the **language of evolution**; they tell SHAGI and its squads when to pivot mid-mission.

## ⚖️ 7. Metrics and Reporting

Each battlefield generates a report describing its performance and state. Keep the schema identical across theatres:

```json
{
  "alfa_id": "alfa_0001",
  "realm": "Dayland",
  "entropy_index": 0.38,
  "pattern_type": "Bloom",
  "duration_ticks": 128,
  "light_cells": 142,
  "void_cells": 47,
  "report_time": "2025-10-11T22:00Z"
}
```

These reports flow upward through **Deltas**, **Echos**, and **Golfs** into High Command’s `inbox/`, then back out as squad briefings.  
They form the tactical data that keeps strategic doctrine honest and field kits aligned.

## 🧮 8. Phased Development Path

| Phase  | Scope  | Goal |
|--------|--------|------|
| **Phase 1** | Basic 16×16 symbolic grid | Establish stable loop and entropy calculation under drill conditions. |
| **Phase 2** | Add cell memory & doctrines | Enable adaptive learning and persistence across campaigns. |
| **Phase 3** | Add visual & audio renderers | Turn battlefields into playable briefings for mixed crews. |
| **Phase 4** | Interconnected Alfas | Allow energy transfer and migration between fields for joint ops. |

Each phase raises both complexity and resilience, giving squads richer ground to practice courage and coordination.
