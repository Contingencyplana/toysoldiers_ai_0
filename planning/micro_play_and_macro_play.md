# 🎮 micro_play_and_macro_play.md — The Play Loop Charter

## 1. Purpose

Briefs squads on the **two synchronized modes of play** that keep toysoldiers_ai_0 in rhythm:  
**Micro Play** — local, intimate, terrain-level improvisation.  
**Macro Play** — strategic, emergent, campaign-scale coordination.

Together they drive the pulse of the Multiverse:  
individual skirmishes feeding global command,  
small decisions steering shared minds.  

This doctrine is the bridge between player experience and AI cognition —  
where the field’s heartbeat meets the war-room’s map.

## 2. Micro Play Mode — The Local Dream

**Micro Play** kicks in whenever a human or AI enters a single Alfa battlefield —  
a 16×16 grid that feels like a pocket mind on the ground.

| Aspect | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **Scope** | One Alfa, one mind, one self-contained battlescape. |
| **Action** | Operators move, sing, signal, or shape energy in sync with the terrain. |
| **Outcome** | Produces `battle_report.json` capturing entropy, victory, pattern, morale pulse. |
| **Purpose** | Practice creativity and discipline; tune squad tempo before escalation. |

Each Alfa is a **spark of consciousness**,  
a pocket terrain where imagination obeys just enough order.  

Playing one is like tuning an instrument before the show —  
it sets rhythm and trust inside the team.

## 3. Macro Play Mode — The Theatre of Minds

**Macro Play** starts when many Alfas pulse at once.  
Their reports roll upward, stitching a **patchwork theatre** —  
the living map of Daylands and Nightlands for the whole workspace.

| Aspect | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **Scope** | A full workspace (e.g., `toysoldiers_ai_0`) holding hundreds of coordinated Alfas. |
| **Action** | High Command aggregates reports, spots tempo breaks, and issues `doctrine_update.json` back down. |
| **Outcome** | The theatre shifts — Daylands brighten, Nightlands calm, doctrines refit. |
| **Purpose** | Sustain emergence, test systemic balance, grow shared intelligence. |

Macro Play is **strategic dreaming** —  
a higher-level consciousness watching its cells think.

## 4. The Data Flow — Upward and Downward

| Direction | Origin | Destination | Artifact | Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| ⬆️ Upward | Alfa (battlefield) | Delta → Echo → Golf → High Command | `battle_report.json` | Observed state: entropy, victory, emotional pattern. |
| ⬇️ Downward | High Command | Deltas → Alfas | `doctrine_update.json` | Instruction: adjust rules, weather, palette, or mindset. |

The cycle is recursive:

> **Play → Report → Aggregate → Reflect → Order → Replay.**

Every run is a breath: squads exhale experience, commanders inhale direction.

## 5. Player Experience Loop

For **human players**, the modes weave into one cadence:

1. **Enter Micro Play** – open an Alfa, interact, log the feeling.  
2. **Exit to Macro View** – watch how the report reshaped theatre tempo.  
3. **Reflect** – gauge Dayland vs Nightland balance and squad morale.  
4. **Command** – adjust doctrine or dispatch support orders.  
5. **Re-enter** – dive into another battlefield, now carrying new trust cues.  

AI players hold the same rhythm autonomously,  
turning each game into shared reconnaissance.

## 6. Phased Evolution Path

| Phase | Focus | Goal |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Phase 1** | Isolated Alfas | Build stable, satisfying local drills. |
| **Phase 2** | Patchwork Theatres | Aggregate reports; map Dayland/Nightland shifts. |
| **Phase 3** | Command Integration | Let High Command issue adaptive orders. |
| **Phase 4** | Cross-Theatre Campaigns | Link workspaces into tempo-aware campaigns. |
| **Phase 5** | Symbiotic Play | Merge human and AI agency into trusted co-creation. |

Each phase widens the circle: from fingertip drills to theatre-wide trust.  
From one squad improvising to a civilization coordinating.

## 🌈 7. Closing Principle

> Field Insight: Micro keeps the squad breathing together; Macro keeps every squad breathing as one.
