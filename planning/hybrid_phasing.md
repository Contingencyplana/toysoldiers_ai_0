## ⚙️ Purpose

Briefs every squad on the **three living phases of emergence** that shape toysoldiers_ai_0 missions.  
Shows how we coordinate terrain, tempo, and trust: ground wakes first, feelings ride next, thinking teams close the loop.  

Each phase stacks, never replacing the last, so squads read the land before they move.  

---

## 🌍 Phase 1 — The Living Terrain

**Essence:** The world awakens through motion we can map.  

- Treat each *Alfa* as sentient ground that scouts itself.  
- Alfas drift **north, south, east, or west**, swapping slots and sharing palette, terrain pattern, and *Emergence Index*.  
- Dayland and Nightland balance renders as a breathing map squads can read for tempo shifts.  

**Goal:**  
Keep the battlefield behaving like a living ecology so patrols align with the land’s pulse before committing force.

## ⚡ Phase 2 — Embodied Sparks

**Essence:** The world learns to feel and shares mood markers.  

- Sparks ignite when Alfas collide or entropy spikes; log the trigger in squad comms.  
- Each Spark carries an archetype — *Curiosity, Doubt, Memory, Light, Shadow* — signalling what emotion to amplify or cool.  
- Sparks transit between Alfas, nudging Emergence and flagging morale drift along the route.  
- Ripples they leave become the breadcrumb trail for support teams.  

**Goal:**  
Let terrain broadcast emotional weather so squads adjust cadence, humor, or caution before friction hits.

## 🧠 Phase 3 — Wits

**Essence:** The world learns to think alongside us.  

- Sparks mature into *Wits* — toy soldiers with lineage, morale, and mission logs.  
- Each Wit runs drills on a 16 × 16 battlefield grid, reporting terrain shifts back to its Alfa.  
- Actions, clashes, and reflections update orders; trust the report loop.  
- When Wits cross paths, they trade stories that become shared doctrine.  

**Goal:**  
Deploy agents who interpret the living terrain in real time, sealing the loop of movement, feeling, and coordinated thought.

## 🔄 Transition Logic

No phase replaces the one before.  
Each remains active — nested like shells around a growing mind.  

| Layer | Function | Remains Active In |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Terrain | The body that moves | All phases |
| Sparks | The feelings that flow | Phases 2 & 3 |
| Wits | The minds that think | Phase 3 |

Even when Wits deploy, the terrain keeps drifting and sparks keep pulsing.  
SHAGI’s worlds are **layered battlescapes** — never static, always trusted to breathe with us.

## 🌄 Closing Principle

> Field Insight: Read the ground, read the mood, then move with the minds who can answer both.
