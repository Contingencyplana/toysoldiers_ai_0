# Doc Refresh Queue - November 2025

> Keep Toysoldiers field scrolls in lockstep with High Command canon before running any missions.

## Ground Rules

- Run the readiness check (`python -m tools.ops_readiness`) before editing so we do not refresh on a red gate.
- Update highest-signal docs first (workspace `README`, `RUNBOOK`, pivotal front scrolls, exchange guides).
- Log each refresh in both `exchange/ledger/2025-11.md` and `C:/Users/Admin/high_command_exchange/ledger/2025-11.md` with scope + actor.
- Capture gaps in `planning/pivotal_fronts/field_ops.md` or bubble them to High Command if they cross workspaces.

## Checklist

- [x] `README.md` (2025-11-18: documented Daily Doc Refresh ritual + queue pointer)
- [x] `RUNBOOK.md` (2025-11-18: added explicit Daily Doc Refresh checklist and logging flow)
- [ ] `planning/pivotal_fronts/field_ops.md` (add doc-refresh policy + links to queue + War Office contract)
- [ ] `exchange/README.md` (explain how doc refresh touches outbox/inbox mirroring + ledger syncs)
- [ ] `planning/field_workspaces.md` (trace Toysoldiers readiness doctrine back to Tenfold doc refresh canon)

## Notes

- Treat the list as rolling; append new targets when pivots or rituals change.
- Keep future items unchecked until their refresh lands and is logged.
- When shared docs (e.g., pivotal fronts) move, coordinate with War Office + High Command Exchange before checking the item.
