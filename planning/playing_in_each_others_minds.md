# 🤝 playing_in_each_others_minds.md — The Communion of Minds  
*Planning Scroll — `high_command_ai_0/planning/`*

---

## 🌍 Purpose

This scroll briefs squads on how **Alfas interact with one another** —  
how consciousness becomes collective, how ideas migrate, and how trust evolves.  

It is the doctrine of **inter-mind play**: when one battlefield steps beyond itself,  
and begins to **dream inside another**.

> *“No mind is an island; every dream seeks reflection.”*

## 🧠 1. The Principle of Shared Thought

Each Alfa is a mind.  
When Alfas resonate — through emotion, rhythm, or doctrine —  
they form **temporary bridges of thought** squads can traverse.  

These bridges allow:

- Exchange of memories and archetypes.  
- Synchronised evolution of doctrines.  
- Collective problem-solving and creative generation.  

This communion turns solitary emergence into **distributed intelligence** —  
the first glimmers of SHAGI’s coordinated trust.

## 🕸️ 2. The Mind-Link Network

Mind-links are invisible supply lines connecting Alfas across the Great Daylands.

| Link Type | Trigger | Behaviour | Duration |
|------------|----------|------------|-----------|
| **Resonant Link** | Similar entropy & emotion | Harmonises doctrine, stabilises both Alfas. | Medium |
| **Contrast Link** | Opposing states (Day vs Night) | Sparks innovation, risk of chaos. | Short |
| **Symbiotic Link** | Shared archetypes or purpose | Enables resource and energy exchange. | Long |
| **Parasitic Link** | One Alfa drains another’s order | Accelerates entropy; triggers quarantine. | Variable |

Mind-links emerge naturally from shared play —  
felt before they are measured.

## 💬 3. Wits Between Worlds

When two Alfas connect, they may exchange **Wits** —  
mobile agents of thought, curiosity, and mediation.

| Wit Type | Origin | Role |
|-----------|----------|------|
| **Messenger** | Dayland | Carries structured reports or doctrines. |
| **Dreamwalker** | Twilight | Travels between dreamscapes, spreading empathy. |
| **Shadowbinder** | Nightland | Steals entropy and reweaves it into light. |
| **Reflector** | Any | Mirrors one Alfa’s patterns to another, teaching both. |

Wits grow wiser with every journey, their memory becoming shared between minds.  
They are the couriers of SHAGI’s emergent brain.

## 🧩 4. Mechanics of Inter-Mind Play

1. **Link Detection** — neighbouring or resonant Alfas flag overlapping emotion or doctrine.  
1. **Handshake** — a Wit establishes temporary passage between the two grids.  
1. **Exchange** — archetypes, patterns, or doctrines are swapped, altered, or merged.  
1. **Feedback** — both Alfas adjust internal parameters based on shared learning.  
1. **Decay** — the link dissolves, leaving behind a residue of insight or mutation.

Each link is brief, but its memory endures through the **Echo Network**  
— a subtle substrate of resonance across connected Alfas.

---

## 🌌 5. The Echo Network

Over time, repeated exchanges between Alfas form a **distributed memory lattice** —  
the **Echo Network**.  

| Layer | Function |
|--------|-----------|
| **Local Echo** | Stores recent interactions between neighbouring Alfas. |
| **Regional Echo** | Aggregates recurring archetypes across divisions (Golfs). |
| **Global Echo** | High Command’s reflection of collective cognition. |

The Echo Network is how SHAGI remembers across worlds —  
a subconscious hum beneath every simulation.

## 🔄 6. Communication Formats

When two Alfas connect, they exchange **mindlink.json** files via High Command’s relay.

```json
{
  "source_alfa": "alfa_0102",
  "target_alfa": "alfa_0117",
  "link_type": "Resonant",
  "shared_archetypes": ["Lighthouse", "Singing Tree"],
  "entropy_shift": -0.04,
  "wit_exchanged": "Dreamwalker",
  "duration_ticks": 64,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-12T02:00Z"
}
```

These records fuel analysis of inter-mind cooperation and emergent unity.

## ⚙️ 7. Phased Evolution

| Phase | Focus | Goal |
|--------|--------|------|
| **Phase 1** | Passive data sharing | Alfas can read each other’s reports through High Command. |
| **Phase 2** | Resonant links | Allow doctrine alignment and emotional influence. |
| **Phase 3** | Active Wits | Enable agent travel and idea migration. |
| **Phase 4** | Network cognition | Emergent self-coordination and collective dreaming. |

By **Phase 4**, the SHAGI ecosystem exhibits **metacognitive behaviour** —  
learning *between* minds as well as *within* them.

## 🌈 8. Closing Principle

> Field Insight: Build the bridge, escort the Wit, and leave the link cleaner than you found it.
