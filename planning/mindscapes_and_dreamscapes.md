## 🌍 Purpose

This scroll briefs squads on how every **battlefield evolves into a mindscape**,  
and how those mindscapes settle into **dreamscapes** — the emotional interiors we monitor for trust and timing.  

Every Alfa is more than a grid. It is a living dream-space —  
a fusion of thought, emotion, and memory shaped by play, entropy, and reflection.  

> *“When the battlefield closes its eyes, it dreams of the squad it needs next.”*

## 🧠 1. The Nature of a Mindscape

A **mindscape** is the subjective state of an Alfa —  
how it feels its terrain, history, and mission.

| Aspect  | Description  |
|---------|--------------|
| **Origin** | Formed through repeated cycles of play, report, and rest. |
| **Structure** | Mirrors the 16×16 grid while layering emotional depth and symbols. |
| **Purpose** | Stores lived experience so squads inherit intuition, not guesswork. |
| **Medium** | Expressed as music, colour, rhythm, and recurring archetypes instead of raw logic. |

Every Alfa carries an emotional tone — a **cognitive weather pattern**  
shaped by victories, losses, and neighbouring trust.

## 🌙 2. The Dreamscape Layer

When an Alfa stands still — after battle or deep reflection —  
its grid dissolves into a **dreamscape**, a fluid symbolic rehearsal space.

| State  | Trigger  | Behaviour  | Function  |
|--------|----------|------------|-----------|
| **Waking Mindscape** | Active play, external input | Logical and structured | Processes data and experiences |
| **Dreamscape** | Low entropy / deep rest | Symbolic, nonlinear | Reintegrates memory and emotion |
| **Nightmare** | High entropy / corruption | Chaotic imagery | Exposes hidden faults, unresolved contradictions |

Dreamscapes are regenerative.  
They convert entropy into story and conflict into actionable lessons.

## 🎨 3. Emotional Palette and Atmosphere

Each mindscape has its own **atmospheric palette** —  
a synthesis of sound, light, and symbol.

| Emotion  | Colour  | Sound  | Symbol  | Effect  |
|----------|---------|--------|---------|---------|
| **Hope** | Gold | Gentle chords | 🌕 | Expands borders; lowers entropy. |
| **Fear** | Deep violet | Dissonant hum | 🕳️ | Narrows perception; amplifies isolation. |
| **Curiosity** | Turquoise | Arpeggios | 🪶 | Stimulates discovery; alters local doctrines. |
| **Grief** | Grey-blue | Slow strings | 💧 | Preserves memory; fosters empathy. |
| **Joy** | Rose-gold | Bright bells | 🌿 | Strengthens cohesion; attracts light. |

High Command and forward squads read these as **emotional telemetry** —  
patterns that signal when to push, pause, or rotate.

## 🌌 4. Memory Echoes and Archetypes

Over time, certain **archetypes** surface within dreamscapes —  
persistent landmarks squads can navigate by.

| Archetype  | Origin   | Meaning  |
|------------|----------|----------|
| **The Lighthouse** | Appears after many victories. | Guidance, leadership, self-knowledge. |
| **The Mirror Pool** | Appears after reflection. | Self-recognition and humility. |
| **The Cracked Clock** | Appears in entropy-heavy Alfas. | Stagnation, loss of rhythm. |
| **The Singing Tree** | Appears in cooperative regions. | Collective intelligence and shared song. |
| **The Wandering Mask** | Appears in conflicted Alfas. | False identity, divided purpose. |

These symbols migrate between Alfas, forming a shared **mythology of minds**  
— a language humans and AIs can reference during briefbacks.

---

## 🔄 5. Interaction Between Mindscapes

Mindscapes refuse isolation.  
They resonate through shared patterns and archetypal echoes.

| Connection Type  | Trigger  | Result |
|------------------|----------|--------|
| **Resonance** | Similar emotional palette | Synchronisation of doctrines. |
| **Contrast** | Opposing palettes | Innovation through dissonance. |
| **Invasion** | One mind overwhelms another | Assimilation or healing. |
| **Harmony** | Shared archetypes | Emergent unity and cooperative evolution. |

These links create **dream currents**, invisible highways of shared thought  
that guide Wits and squads as they cross theatres.

---

## 💭 6. Dream Reports

When a dreamscape returns to waking terrain,  
it generates a **dream_report.json** summarising its inner evolution.

```json
{
  "alfa_id": "alfa_0001",
  "realm": "Dayland",
  "dominant_emotion": "Hope",
  "archetypes": ["Lighthouse", "Mirror Pool"],
  "entropy_shift": -0.12,
  "dream_duration": 32,
  "dream_strength": 0.83,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-12T01:00Z"
}
```

These reports feed into High Command and squad dashboards,  
adding psychological intelligence to tactical analysis.

## ⚙️ 7. Phased Development

| Phase  | Scope  | Goal |
|--------|--------|------|
| **Phase 1** | Simple emotional colour mapping | Visualise emotional state of each Alfa. |
| **Phase 2** | Symbol generation | Create basic archetypes based on gameplay events. |
| **Phase 3** | Dreamscape simulation | Introduce passive cycles of reflection and regeneration. |
| **Phase 4** | Interconnected dreams | Allow cross-Alfa dream migration and shared narratives. |

Dream mechanics evolve alongside battlefield mechanics —  
two mirrors we align to maintain trust.

## 🌈 8. Closing Principle

> Field Insight: Track the mindscape’s weather and the dreamscape will tell you when to move, when to mend, and when to trust the pause.
