# Emoji Translator Spike â€” Phase Report

**Author:** toysoldiers_ai_0  
**Date:** 2025-10-25  
**Status:** In progress (Phase 1â€“3 complete)

---

## Phase Checklist

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Translator prototype | âœ… | `tools/emoji_translator_spike.py` loads the Level-0 lexicon, compiles glyph chains, and emits factory-order payload stubs with deterministic round-trip logging. |
| Narration stub | âœ… | Translator exposes narration-ready summary strings; interface prepared for future TTS/audio binding. |
| Validation hook | âœ… | Generated telemetry stubs run through `validate_schema` and `validate_dq` from `tools/validate_order_021.py`, with results appended to spike log entries. |
| Synthesis report | ðŸŸ¡ | This document tracks findings; final go/no-go pending Toyfoundry + War Office review. |

## Runtime Artifacts

- **Lexicon:** `planning/emoji_language/glyph_lexicon_level0.json`
- **Translator Prototype:** `tools/emoji_translator_spike.py`
- **Sample Chain:** `samples/emoji_commands/level0_sample.json`
- **Round-Trip Log:** `planning/emoji_language/spike_logs/translator_round_trips.jsonl`

## Findings

1. **Deterministic Mapping** â€” Each glyph is resolved by emoji or id and mapped to canonical Toyfoundry rituals/statuses. The `VERB_CANONICAL_RITUAL` bridge aligns Level-0 verbs to existing Order 021 invariants.
2. **Narration Readiness** â€” `build_summary` returns a sentence suitable for narration; swapping in TTS requires only a hook into the interface established in the translator module.
3. **Validator Compatibility** â€” Telemetry stubs derived from glyph chains pass schema and data quality checks, confirming the bridge can reuse Order 021 guardrails without additional tooling.
4. **Logging for Replay** â€” JSONL log captures glyph chain, resolved intent, payload, and validation verdict for future analytics or regression tests.

## Open Items Before Hardening

- **Outcome Canon Expansion:** Current status mapping collapses Level-0 outcomes into success/warning/error for validator compatibility. Need War Office guidance on whether additional status codes should be admitted into Order 021 rules.
- **Narration Assets:** Lore team to supply approved copy + TTS voicepack; translator already exposes the textual hooks.
- **Shared Service Decision:** Determine whether the translator lives inside Toysoldiers, Toyfoundry, or as a shared microservice before broader rollout.
- **Persistence Format:** Logs currently JSONL; evaluate if sessions require structured storage (SQLite or telemetry stream) for large-scale adoption.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Review spike output with Toyfoundry to confirm payload shape meets ritual expectations.
2. War Office to sign off on narration tone and outcome taxonomy adjustments.
3. Once approvals land, promote the translator into a shared runtime package and extend validator coverage to glyph-aware manifests.
