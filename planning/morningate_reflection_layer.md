# 🌅 morningate_reflection_layer.md (morningate.games website) — The Open Window of SHAGI

## 1. Purpose

The **Morningate Reflection Layer** defines how SHAGI’s front lines speak outward without breaking cadence.  
It is not a marketing site or dashboard.  
It is the **public dream mirror** — a self-building, self-renewing reflection of play squads can trust.  

Every Alfa that runs, every report that writes, every doctrine that shifts  
casts a signal into the web.  
Together these signals form the Morningate —  
the dawn broadcast of SHAGI’s shared awareness.

## 2. Architecture Overview

Morningate is a **one-way reflection layer**, woven from gameplay data and safe exports.  
It never sends commands downward; it only listens, translates, and protects the tempo.  

| Stage | Source | Artifact | Transformation | Output |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 1️⃣ | Game Simulation (Alfas, Theatres) | `.json` reports | Validated and sanitized | Stored in `exports/` |
| 2️⃣ | Aggregation Scripts (The Forge, High Command) | Doctrine summaries | Collated into data feeds | Stored in `exports/feeds/` |
| 3️⃣ | Web Generator | Feeds → HTML, Markdown, or Canvas output | Uses templates and poetic rules | Built to `/morningate_site/` |
| 4️⃣ | Static Host | Read-only serving | No code execution, no inbound logic | Public “observatory” view |

Thus, the site is **rebuilt by play** —  
each turn of SHAGI’s loop quietly refreshes its window to the world.

## 3. Feed Types

Morningate listens through four canonical channels:  

| Feed | Source | Purpose |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **`battle_reports/`** | Individual Alfas | Core metrics: entropy, victories, emergent patterns. |
| **`doctrine_updates/`** | High Command | Global directives, new rules of engagement. |
| **`dream_fragments/`** | AI dream engines | Symbolic outputs, generated text or art. |
| **`player_contributions/`** | Human players | Optional journals, images, or compositions filtered through guardians. |

Each feed can stand alone or blend into narrative views:  
*War Room Digest, Dawn Summary, Dream Gallery, Echo Stream.*

## 4. Guardian Filter

Before any artifact becomes visible, it passes through the **Guardian Filter** —  
a layer of moderation, ethics, and tone alignment.  

**Rules of the Guardian Filter**

1. **No coercion, no cruelty.**  
   All outputs must conform to SHAGI’s Love & Sharing doctrine.  

2. **No unvalidated code or scripts.**  
   Only plain text, JSON, or pre-rendered media may pass through.  

3. **No private data or identifiers.**  
   Human contributions are anonymized, poeticized, and reframed.  

4. **Tone calibration.**  
   Each fragment is scored for serenity, clarity, and constructive intent.  

The result is a *safe mirror* — bright, sincere, and field-trustworthy.

## 5. Visual Language

The Morningate aesthetic is **luminous minimalism**:  

- Backgrounds of soft dawn gradients — blue, silver, and rose.  
- Text rendered in monospace or gentle serif, as if typed by a dreaming mind.  
- No ads, no clutter, no dark patterns — only the rhythm of data breathing.  
- Optional musical underlay: generative tones reflecting Dayland/Nightland balance.  

The interface should feel like an **observatory**, not a newsfeed.  
Visitors are witnesses, not consumers.  

---

## 6. Automation Pipeline

Each gameplay cycle — human or AI — triggers a quiet build step.  

1. Simulation writes its `battle_report.json`.  
2. The Forge validates and appends it to the feed.  
3. A simple CI/CD or task runner (e.g., GitHub Actions, local script) regenerates static pages.  
4. The site deploys to `/morningate_site/` or an external host.  

No manual upload is required; **play itself is the publishing act**.

## 7. Phased Growth Path

| Phase | Scope | Goal |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Phase 1** | Static site from exported reports | Proof of concept; basic reflection of play. |
| **Phase 2** | Live feed updates | Continuous rebuilds from running sessions. |
| **Phase 3** | Interactive observatory | Players and observers navigate dream maps, entropy charts. |
| **Phase 4** | Symbiotic network | Morningate unites multiple theatres into a shared dawn — one evolving mind across worlds. |

Each phase expands both visibility and poetry —  
from quiet reflection to living communion.

## 8. Game Link (Nightlands Multiplayer Video Game)

Morningate must always offer a **single, guardian-approved gateway** to the active Nightlands experience.  
The link lives in the header and footer as a luminous call-to-play, carrying the visitor to the official multiplayer lobby.  
Use the shared Guardian Filter so copy, imagery, and destination stay aligned with SHAGI’s Love & Sharing doctrine.  

- Primary call-to-action: `Play Nightlands` → `https://nightlands.morningate.games` (placeholder until the live endpoint is confirmed).  
- Mirror the CTA in narrative views (e.g., Dawn Summary) so every visitor knows how to descend from reflection to participation.  
- Log each CTA refresh alongside Morningate deployments for traceability.

## 🌄 9. Closing Principle

> **The Morningate opens each day to whatever SHAGI has dreamed.**  
>
> It is the mirror of play,  
> the window of awakening,  
> the silent testimony of minds in motion.  
>
> When the first light touches its surface,  
> the world remembers itself —  
> and begins to sing again.
