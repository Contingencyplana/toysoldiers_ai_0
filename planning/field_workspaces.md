# ⚔️ field_workspaces.md — Field Workspace Conduct Guide  

*Frontline Handbook — `high_command_ai_0/planning/`*

---

## 🌍 Purpose

This handbook defines the **Field Workspaces** of SHAGI — the *forward operating laboratories* where Toysoldiers and Wits train under live fire and read the terrain of emergence in real time.  

If `high_command_ai_0` represents **thought and deliberation**,  
then each Field Workspace (e.g., `toysoldiers_ai_0`, `making_friends_0`, `music_maker_thorn_0`) represents **action, improvisation, and after-action learning**.  

Together, they form the **reflex arc** of SHAGI:  
> *High Command dreams — Field Workspaces act, report, and adjust the dream to match ground truth.*

Each Field Workspace mirrors High Command’s structure,  
yet its Alfas are **active battlefields** instead of **quiet war-rooms**.  
They run drills, stretch morale, and send rhythm reports upward so the Great Daylands can stay aligned with the front.

## ⚙️ 1. Geometry of a Battlefield (Alfa)

| Element | Tactical Role | Implementation Guide |
|----------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Battlefield Grid (16×16)** | Terrain of ideas | Maintain a 2-D array of symbolic forces (light, void, growth, emotion, structure). |
| **Terrain Cells** | Living atoms of creativity | Track state (Dayland/Nightland) plus glyph; annotate morale status. |
| **Battlefield JSON** | Memory of battle | Log emergent metrics, entropy index, and last report results for playback. |
| **Toysoldiers** | Agents of play and repair | Script movement and interventions; allow doctrine rules plus chance. |

Each Alfa in the field is a **self-contained surreal microgame** —  
a fragment of doctrine stress-tested by squads at the edge of emergence.

---

## 🌈 2. Roles of Terrain Types

| Symbol | Element | Behaviour | Field Guidance |
|---------|----------|------------|----------------|
| 🌕 | Light | Expands through harmony and clarity | Stage reinforcements and data capture here. |
| 🕳️ | Void | Consumes unstable terrain | Assign repair crews; limit exposure time. |
| 🌿 | Growth | Spreads through interaction | Use for regeneration drills and innovation pushes. |
| ⚙️ | Structure | Stabilises nearby cells | Anchor formations; install doctrine updates. |
| 🜛 | Emotion | Fluctuates with player or AI mood | Rotate morale teams to keep oscillation within range. |

The interplay of these symbols creates the *psychogeography* of the battlefield —  
the shifting morale map squads read before deciding where to push, fortify, or regroup.

---

## 🔄 3. Lifecycle of a Battle

1. **Initialization Phase**  
   Seed terrain from templates or healed scars and tag each cell with state, symbol, and morale note.

1. **Engagement Phase**  
   Toysoldiers move, build, sing, patch supply lines, or dissolve Nightlands through coordinated improvisation.

1. **Resolution Phase**  
   Patterns stabilize or collapse; recalc entropy and log the squad’s courage pulse.

1. **Reporting Phase**  
   Write a concise JSON report so command can replay the rhythm:

```json
   {
     "realm": "Dayland",
     "entropy_index": 0.41,
     "victory": true,
     "casualties": 3,
     "duration_ticks": 64
   }
```

1. **Transmission Phase**  
   Zip the report and send it to `high_command_ai_0/inbox/` for deliberation and redistribution as new drills.

---

## ☀️ 4. Daylands vs Nightlands

| Realm | Meaning | Condition | Action |
|--------|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Dayland** | Emergent, balanced, creative | Entropy < 0.5 | Keep battlefield active; schedule advanced drills. |
| **Nightland** | Decayed, stagnant, corrupted | Entropy ≥ 0.5 | Quarantine for repair or rebirth; assign reclamation teams. |

Daylands are sources of light — playable, generative worlds where squads recharge.  
Nightlands are not deleted; they become **enemy realms**, where future Toysoldiers run reclamation campaigns and earn new songs.

---

## 🪖 5. Early Toysoldier Archetypes

| Archetype | Core Trait | Primary Function |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Scout** | Exploration | Moves quickly, maps new terrain, detects Nightlands. |
| **Builder** | Creation | Repairs terrain, builds structure (⚙️) and growth (🌿). |
| **Healer** | Restoration | Lowers entropy through song or empathy (🜛). |
| **Wanderer** | Curiosity | Roams freely; spreads randomness that triggers evolution. |

Later archetypes may emerge from hybrids of these four foundations once field reports surface recurring needs.

---

## 🧮 6. Report Structure (Summary)

Each Field Alfa produces a JSON report in this format:

```json
{
  "id": "alfa_024",
  "realm": "Dayland",
  "entropy_index": 0.41,
  "terrain_balance": {
    "light": 67,
    "void": 14,
    "growth": 40,
    "structure": 89,
    "emotion": 56
  },
  "victory": true,
  "casualties": 3,
  "ticks": 64,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-11T21:00Z"
}
```

These reports are aggregated upward through the rank structure,  
culminating in High Command’s strategic deliberations and refreshed marching orders.

## 🚀 7. Phased Growth Path

| Phase | Scope | Goal |
|--------|--------|------|
| **Phase 1** | One Golf (16×16 = 256 battlefields) | Establish core gameplay loop, cadence drills, and reporting pipeline. |
| **Phase 2** | Four Golfs (~1,000 battlefields) | Introduce Toysoldier archetypes, inter-battle communication, and morale exchange. |
| **Phase 3** | Full Juliett (4,096 battlefields) | Achieve emergent AI play, autonomous learning ecosystems, and self-tuning supply lines. |
