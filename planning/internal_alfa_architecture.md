## 🌍 Purpose

Briefs squads on the **internal architecture of each Alfa** —  
the smallest living unit where terrain, tempo, and trust align.  

Every Alfa is both **battlefield** and **brain**,  
a 16-rank microcosm that echoes the full SHAGI hierarchy in miniature.  

High Command may oversee thousands, yet each Alfa runs its own command chain:  
layers of logic, data, and memory that squads can query mid-mission.  

> *“Each Alfa is a miniature civilization of thought — a forward post that listens back.”*

## 🧩 1. The Sixteen Internal Ranks

Each rank is a layer of perception or functionality inside the Alfa.  
Together, they form the inner operations tent squads lean on.

| Rank | Role inside one Alfa | Kind of Logic it Holds | File Type |
|------|------------------------|-------------------------|------------|
| **Alfa** | Local battlefield mechanics | cell rules, visuals | `.py` |
| **Bravo** | Squad-level coordination | neighbouring-cell logic | `.json` |
| **Charlie** | Communication layer | messaging / events | `.json` |
| **Delta** | Regional balance | entropy metrics | `.json` |
| **Echo** | Memory | report logging | `.json` |
| **Foxtrot** | Aesthetics | colour / sound synthesis | `.py` |
| **Golf** | Doctrine | local rule mutation | `.json` |
| **Hotel** | Infrastructure | asset links / caching | `.json` |
| **India** | Intelligence | pattern recognition | `.py` |
| **Juliett** | Oversight | AI learning / scoring | `.json` |
| **Kilo → Papa (11–16)** | Expansion slots | future logic tiers (diplomacy, ethics, prophecy) | `.json` or `.py` |

Each rank touches a distinct facet of emergence —  
from raw play (Alfa) to oversight (Juliett) and, ultimately, shared foresight (Papa).

## ⚙️ 2. File Layout Example

Each Alfa has its own folder containing up to sixteen sub-files squads can audit:  

```plaintext
alfas/
 └─ alfa_0001_mind_of_valor/
     ├─ alfa.py           # core battlefield logic
     ├─ bravo.json        # local squad parameters
     ├─ charlie.json      # communication settings
     ├─ delta.json        # metrics / reports
     ├─ echo.json         # memory / logs
     ├─ foxtrot.py        # aesthetic hooks
     ├─ golf.json         # rule mutations
     ├─ hotel.json        # asset registry
     ├─ india.py          # pattern learner
     ├─ juliett.json      # global scoring
     ├─ kilo.json         # placeholder for higher logic
     ├─ lima.json
     ├─ mike.json
     ├─ november.json
     ├─ oscar.json
     ├─ papa.json
     └─ manifest.json     # summary of all sixteen ranks
```

Each file stays small — hundreds of bytes to a few kilobytes —  
keeping the “mind” lightweight enough for quick transfer between fire teams.

## 🧠 3. Execution Flow

1. **Initialization** — `alfa.py` loads configuration and manifest; squads confirm terrain status.  
1. **Selective Activation** — only needed ranks spin up, conserving tempo.  
1. **Simulation Loop** — 16×16 grid evolves while higher ranks assist:  

  - *Bravo*: neighbour awareness for squad alignment.  
  - *Charlie*: event routing to keep comms trustworthy.  
  - *Delta*: entropy checks for terrain stability.  
  - *Echo*: memory write for after-action story.  

1. **Post-Processing** — metrics and logs refresh; `manifest.json` posts the results.  
1. **Reporting** — key outcomes (entropy, victory, learning delta) transmit upward with morale notes.  

Higher ranks behave like **plug-ins** or **caches** — extending reach without slowing the core loop.

## 🗃️ 4. Manifest Specification

`manifest.json` serves as the **table of contents** and health summary for each Alfa.

```json
{
  "id": "alfa_0001_mind_of_valor",
  "realm": "Dayland",
  "ranks": {
    "alfa": "ok",
    "bravo": "ok",
    "charlie": "ok",
    "delta": "ok",
    "echo": "ok",
    "foxtrot": "ok",
    "golf": "ok",
    "hotel": "ok",
    "india": "ok",
    "juliett": "ok"
  },
  "entropy_index": 0.42,
  "last_run": "2025-10-11T21:00Z",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "checksums": {
    "alfa.py": "SHA256:XXXX",
    "manifest.json": "SHA256:YYYY"
  }
}
```

High Command and squads alike can read this manifest to brief quickly,  
no deep file spelunking required.

## 🔄 5. Lifecycle of an Alfa

| Phase  | Description  | Action  |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| **Load** | Read `.json` state and manifest. | Prepare terrain, ranks, and parameters. |
| **Simulate** | Run 16×16 grid logic via `alfa.py`. | Trigger plug-ins as needed. |
| **Record** | Write new metrics and entropy. | Update rank data and memory. |
| **Report** | Produce summarized `.json`. | Send report upward with terrain/morale status. |
| **Evolve** | Adjust doctrines via `golf.json` or learning via `india.py`. | Prep next iteration with squad feedback. |

---

## 🚀 6. Phased Expansion Strategy

| Phase  | Scope  | Goal |
|--------|--------|------|
| **Phase 1** | Minimal pair: `alfa.py` + `alfa.json` | Establish simulation loop and reporting. |
| **Phase 2** | Add Bravo–Juliett ranks | Introduce modular functionality and AI hooks. |
| **Phase 3** | Add Kilo–Papa ranks | Integrate higher cognitive and creative layers. |
| **Phase 4** | Networked Alfas | Enable mind-to-mind communication and emergent group behaviour. |

Automation scripts (**“The Forge”**) keep rank files current so squads focus on tempo, not paperwork.

## 🌈 7. Benefits of Internal Hierarchy

| Aspect  | Advantage  |
|---------|------------|
| **Scalable** | Thousands of Alfas × 16 small files remain manageable. |
| **Modular** | Each file can evolve independently. |
| **Lore-consistent** | Every Alfa literally contains its higher minds. |
| **Automatable** | The Forge can generate all ranks automatically. |
| **Traceable** | Any rank can be reviewed or swapped without breaking trust. |

## 🌄 8. Closing Principle

> Field Insight: Every Alfa is a pocket command post—know its ranks and the terrain will trust you back.
