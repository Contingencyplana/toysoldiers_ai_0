# Campaigns and Lulls

Purpose: name the operating rhythm - Campaign -> Lull -> Next Campaign - so teams share vocabulary, cadence, and a compact chronicle of major/minor pushes.

## Lexicon
- Era/Phase: long arc crossing many campaigns (e.g., Foundation -> Post-Foundation/Refinement).
- Campaign (Major/Minor): multi-order push to close dependencies. Major spans multiple fronts; Minor is narrower.
- Operation/Sprint: time-boxed execution unit inside a campaign.
- Order: atomic directive with ack/report/ledger artifacts (exchange/orders, exchange/reports, exchange/ledger).
- Lull (Stabilization): active window to triage inbox, refresh docs, validate tooling, and plan the next campaign.

## Cadence
- Lull checklist: clear `exchange/reports/inbox`, run `tools/exchange_heartbeat.py`, sync via `tools/offline_sync_exchange.py`, refresh docs/roadmaps, and capture readiness.
- Plan: define objectives, success criteria, dependencies, and provisional order IDs.
- Execute: issue orders, close dependencies, validate (schema + contract tests), and keep the ledger current.
- Debrief: archive reports/acks, update ledger, note lessons; return to lull.

## Current State Snapshot

- Orders queue: 040/041/043/045/047/048/049/050/051 closed; follow-on Orders 052/057 completed (ledger 2025-11-17 entries) and emitter/hybrid verification logged 2025-11-23 (see `C:\Users\Admin\high_command_exchange\ledger\2025-11.md`); planning lull continues post-057.
- Inbox: last recorded clear 2025-11-09 with backlog archived to `exchange/reports/archived/inbox_backlog/`; schedule a fresh sweep and log outcome to the ledger.
- Recent completions: 040/041/043/045/047/048/049/050/051/052/057 closed; reports and acks archived (see `C:\Users\Admin\high_command_exchange\ledger\index.json`).
- Document refresh cadence: daily slices running from `planning/commonwealth_loop/doc_refresh_queue.md`; last logged TonsOfFun DOC-REFRESH on 2025-11-17 in `C:\Users\Admin\high_command_exchange\ledger\2025-11.md`; next slice pending.
- Nightlands playtest: 2025-11-12 cohort (Vega, Lumen, Rook) ran the duet comfort loop; feedback archived in `logs/alfa_zero/play_session_feedback/` with follow-up work queued.

## Next Campaign Stack (agreed)

- Campaign 1: Core loop + thin UI -> 10-15 minute co-op loop, single extraction win, minimal battlegrid/observer view + HUD; inputs stay under guardrails; instrument Time-to-Fun, revive cadence, and "one more run?" prompts.
- Campaign 2: Emoji-first command layer (UI-aligned) -> abilities/pings via emoji DSL (quick-cast wheels + textless comms); 90s emoji-only tutorial; UI uses the DSL; track command latency/accuracy.
- Campaign 3: Battlegrid scenario builder -> lightweight encounter authoring (battlegrid + prefab packs), validated exports through cadence to the hub.
- Execution: small slices, smoke/ledger hooks, rollback toggles; thin UI layered during Campaigns 1-2.

### Campaign 1 - Core Loop + Thin UI (Detailed Plan)

- Goal/non-goal: 10-15 min co-op loop; single extraction win; minimal HUD/battlegrid; avoid sprawling content/bosses this slice.
- Milestones: M1 core loop prototype (roles, 1-2 enemies, signature abilities gated by guardrails); M2 thin UI/HUD + telemetry hooks (Time-to-Fun, revives, "one more run?"); M3 playtestable slice with smoke/ledger entries and rollback toggles.
- KPIs: Time-to-Fun, revive cadence, "one more run?" rate; UI/emoji command latency; crash/safety budget adherence.
- Dependencies/risks: emoji DSL + guardrails in place; perf/safety smoke available; hybrid cadence green; rollback switches; logging to hub.
- Execution ritual: per-slice cadence (heartbeat -> offline sync -> ops_readiness -> exchange_all), emitter smoke, ledger notes/evidence hooks per milestone.

### Lull - UI Overlay Slice

- Status: Entered stabilization lull following Order 045 closure.
- Closed anchors: 045 (UI overlay integration), 047 (targeted sync CLI), 048 (storyboard run), 049 (playtest), 050 (scoreboard imagery), 051 (telemetry feed panel).
- Tracked follow-ups (not blocking lull):
  - Integrate Nightlands feed into the primary dashboard once tooling returns.
  - Decide targeted-sync log rotation after a few additional playtests.
  - Continue appending storyboard/targeted-sync runs to the feed during future sessions.

## Campaign Brief - Order 045: UI Overlay Integration Slice

- Status: **Completed 2025-11-12 (order-2025-11-09-045 closed)**
- Type: Minor (runtime shells and overlay integration)
- Objective: Deliver a demonstrable UI overlay slice that exercises narration and telemetry pipelines while locking validation coverage before broader rollout.

### Pillars

- Runtime shells upgraded with overlay hooks, logging hygiene, and comfort toggles across `golf_00/delta_00/alfa_02` and `golf_00/delta_00/alfa_03` (Order 045 Day 0 instrumentation).
- UI overlay proof path capturing one end-to-end interaction through the comfort loop with retained trace artifacts.
- Validation runway extending the contract suite plus baseline heartbeat and offline sync sweep.

### Milestones

- Baseline readiness sweep captured and filed with evidence links.
- Overlay instrumentation merged into runtime shells with documented entry points and toggles.
- Contract suite passes with the new overlay regression case.
- Comfort and planning docs updated with operator runbook and stretch backlog.

### Evidence Hooks (045)

- Order: `exchange/orders/completed/order-2025-11-09-045.json`
- Ledger: `exchange/ledger/index.json`
- Runtime shells: `golf_00/delta_00/alfa_02/`, `golf_00/delta_00/alfa_03/`
- Contract suite: `tools/contract_test_runner.py`
- Comfort guide: `exchange/attachments/guides/comfort_happy_path.md`
- Overlay traces: `logs/alfa_02/narration.jsonl`, `logs/alfa_03/telemetry.jsonl`

### Stretch Considerations (045)

- Cross-workspace overlay rollout once the slice stabilizes.
- Expanded manifest automation for narrator and telemetry assets.

### Window (045)

- 2025-11-09 -> 2025-11-16 (target seven-day minor campaign cadence).

## Campaign Brief - Order 044: Relieve the President's Burden

- Status: **Completed 2025-11-08 (order-2025-11-07-044 closed)**
- Type: Major (cross-workspace automation + comfort improvements)
- Objective: Reduce routine operational load on High Command while increasing playability and narrative coherence during everyday work.

### Success Criteria

- Inbox triage flow: repeatable checklist; target "inbox zero" after campaign close (all reports archived/linked in ledger).
- Automation: reduce manual ack/report handling by a measurable percentage using existing exchange tools (no new infra if avoidable).
- Runtime readiness: minimal narrator/telemetry shells available for `alfa_02`/`alfa_03` to support monitoring and VO alignment.
- Contract coverage: extend contract tests to include at least one "automation path" case; all cases pass locally.
- Comfort: document a 70/30 play/dev-ops path (single "happy path" from overlay -> logs -> exchange sync).

### Progress Log

- Step 1 (2025-11-08T11:40Z) - Exchange inbox verified clear; ledger primed for Order 044 evidence.
- Step 2 (2025-11-08T11:45Z) - Exchange heartbeat [OK], acknowledgement logged, and offline sync mirrored latest orders/reports ahead of runtime shell work.
- Step 3 (2025-11-08T11:46Z) - Narrator/telemetry shells exercised; comfort guide updated with commands.
- Step 4 (2025-11-08T11:47Z) - Added `automation_path_happy_flow` contract case; contract runner passes focused sweep.
- Step 5 (2025-11-08T11:50Z) - Published comfort happy path refresh and automation quick-start guide to anchor the 70/30 loop.
- Step 6 (2025-11-08T11:55Z) - Completion report archived and ledger closed for Order 044.

### Retrospective (2025-11-08)

- **Wins** heartbeat discipline, refreshed guides, and the automation contract case kept comfort and tooling evidence aligned within a single campaign arc.
- **Friction** acknowledgement timing drifted before we realigned it with the ledger, and runtime shells stayed minimal stubs that still need explicit follow-up.
- **Action Items** capture lull lessons in planning docs, schedule shell enhancements for the UI order, and keep the comfort loop verified during every lull exit.

### Dependencies

- `quint_synced/` alignment docs adopted across fronts (payload + narration).
- `golf_00/delta_00/alfa_02` and `alfa_03` scaffolds activated (even minimally) to host narrator/telemetry shells.
- Exchange heartbeat reachable with correct `SHAGI_EXCHANGE_PATH` on all workspaces.
- Inbox triage for outstanding safety/analytics reports.

### Deliverables

- Updated guides: lull checklist and automation quick-start in `exchange/attachments/guides/`.
- Minimal narrator/telemetry shell entry points under `golf_00/delta_00/alfa_02` / `alfa_03` (even stubs with TODOs).
- Extended contract samples exercising an automation path.
- Final report and ACK for Order 044 archived in exchange.

### Evidence Hooks

- Ledger: `exchange/ledger/journal.md`
- Reports: `exchange/reports/archived/order-2025-11-07-044-report.json`
- Tools: `tools/exchange_heartbeat.py`, `tools/offline_sync_exchange.py`, `tools/contract_test_runner.py`

### Risks & Mitigations

- Scope creep: keep "automation" to lightweight scripts and docs; avoid new infra.
- Schema drift: validate with `tools/schema_validator.py` + contract tests before closing.
- Partial runtime wiring: deliver minimal shells first, then iterate.

### Window

- 2025-11-08 -> 2025-11-12 (day 1: inbox triage + runtime shell stubs; day 2+: automation coverage, comfort docs, validation).
