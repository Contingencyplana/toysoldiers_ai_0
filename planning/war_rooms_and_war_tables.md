# 🧠 war_rooms_and_war_tables.md — War-Room Conduct Guide  

*Frontline Handbook — `high_command_ai_0/planning/`*

## 🌍 Purpose

This handbook briefs the **microstructure of High Command** — the internal life of each Alfa within  
`high_command_ai_0`, also known as a **War-Room**.  

Where field Alfas fight on terrain, High Command Alfas fight for clarity —  
places where ideas, data, and strategy collide under a ticking clock.  

Each War-Room runs a **16×16 grid of deliberation** split into four War-Tables.  
Every table seats **16 staff officers (wits)** tasked with turning raw reports into orders the field can trust.

## ⚙️ 1. Geometry of the War-Room

| Element | Tactical Role | Implementation Guide |
|----------|---------------|----------------------|
| **War-Room Grid (16×16)** | Common operating picture | Keep a 2-D array of 256 decision nodes; each node tracks reports, metrics, or options with timestamps. |
| **4 War-Tables (4×4 sub-grids)** | Focused deliberation cells | Lock sub-grids to specialist missions: **Intel**, **Logistics**, **Morale**, **R&D**. |
| **16 Staff Officers per Table** | Analytic fireteams | Configure agent objects to read data, weigh options, and vote; majority plus variance flags form the table verdict. |
| **War-Room JSON** | Published order packet | Archive consensus ratio, entropy index, doctrine updates, and recommended orders for chain-of-command review. |

Every War-Room is one **Alfa-pair**: a `.py` file (logic) + a `.json` file (state).  
Treat the pair as a living log of collective reasoning and ensure both files deploy together.

## 🧭 2. Roles of the Four War-Tables

| Table | Focus | Typical Inputs | Outputs |
|--------|--------|----------------|----------|
| **Intel** | Information integrity | Field reports, metrics, scout data | Validated data, confidence scores, red flags |
| **Logistics** | Resource tempo | Production stats, supply indices | Allocation plans, risk-of-shortfall alerts |
| **Morale** | Human & AI steadiness | Emotional indicators, team feedback | Stability rating, morale recovery drills |
| **R&D** | Innovation pressure | New strategies, mutations, code patches | Doctrine updates, prototype orders, test windows |

Each table maintains its own dialect of order and uncertainty.  
War-Room leads stitch those voices into a single broadcast for the theatre.

## 🔄 3. Lifecycle of a Strategic Deliberation

1. **Input Phase**  
   Pull compressed field reports from linked Delta/Echo clusters and stamp reception times.

2. **Analysis Phase**  
   Assign War-Tables to parse their streams with standing checklists and annotate anomalies.

3. **Deliberation Phase**  
   Run the 16×16 exchange for *N* ticks; enforce vote cadence, influence caps, and escalation rules.

4. **Consensus Phase**  
   When consensus ≥ threshold, package results into `order.json` or `doctrine_update.json` with trace notes.

5. **Output Phase**  
   Dispatch the packet to the theatre through `high_command_ai_0/orders/` and notify receiving commanders.

6. **Entropy Phase**  
   Track contradiction and data decay; when entropy breaches limits, mark transition to **Nightland** and trigger repair protocols.

## ☀️ 4. Transition States

| State | Symbol | Meaning | Action |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| **Dayland** | 🟢 | Clear reasoning, consistent output | Room active; continue routine audits |
| **Horizon** | 🟡 | Rising contradiction, partial breakdown | Issue caution orders; schedule remedial drill |
| **Nightland** | 🔴 | Cognitive collapse or recursive confusion | Quarantine immediately; deploy repair or swap in reserve room |

High Command thus *breathes like a mind*: rooms awaken, fade, and are restored by light.

## 👥 5. Early Wit Archetypes

Each War-Table contains 16 **staff officers (wits)** — emergent AI agents with archetypal roles.

| Archetype | Core Trait | Function in Debate |
|------------|-------------|--------------------|
| **Analyst** | Rational precision | Verifies data streams, flags entropy drift |
| **Optimist** | Creative synthesis | Generates new strategies and rescue lines |
| **Doubter** | Skeptical rigor | Challenges assumptions, demands counter-proof |
| **Synthesist** | Integrative insight | Merges diverse inputs into one executable doctrine |

Rotate archetypes through after-action clinics to keep debates sharp and doctrine relevant.

## 🧮 6. Data Representation (Example)

**`warroom_001.json`**

```json
{
  "name": "War-Room of the Rising Sun",
  "realm": "Dayland",
  "entropy_index": 0.23,
  "tables": {
    "intel": {"consensus": 0.84},
    "logistics": {"consensus": 0.72},
    "morale": {"consensus": 0.68},
    "rnd": {"consensus": 0.91}
  },
  "order": {
    "type": "doctrine_update",

## 🚀 7. Phased Implementation Path

| Phase | Scope | Goal |
|--------|--------|------|
| **Phase 1** | One Golf block (16×16 = 256 War-Rooms) | Build, run, and validate the report→order loop under live drills. |
| **Phase 2** | Four Golfs (~1,000 War-Rooms) | Enable inter-room communication and track wit evolution metrics. |
| **Phase 3** | Full Juliett (4,096 War-Rooms) | Sustain autonomous strategic coordination across all theatres. |

## 🧊 8. Quadrants, Pins, and Motion

War-Rooms must read cleanly at a glance. Quadrant grammar keeps cognition visible without drowning operators in micromanagement.

### Quadrant Layout

| Visual | Meaning | Implementation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| Background tint | Health of its War-Table | Map color to consensus or entropy thresholds. |
| Center pins | Active threads that table commands | Treat each pin as a JSON node with type and state link. |
| Edge officers | Current wit archetypes on duty | Seat four officers on each side (north, east, south, west). |
| Floor glyph | Traversable tile | Replace with officer or pin symbol on occupation. |

### Pins as Polymorphic Symbols

| Table | Pin Represents | Sample Payload |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Intel | Sensor node or scout cluster | `{ "pin_id": "i_07", "reports": 42 }` |
| Logistics | Convoy or supply line | `{ "pin_id": "l_03", "capacity": 120 }` |
| Morale | Emotional cluster or story arc | `{ "pin_id": "m_02", "tone": "hopeful" }` |
| R&D | Experiment or prototype thread | `{ "pin_id": "r_11", "version": "0.3.1" }` |

The icon stays consistent (a pin denotes an active focus) while the payload varies by table.

### Growth Cadence

Start sparse and let rooms earn complexity:

1. **Level 0:** Empty floor grid, no pins or officers.
2. **Level 1:** Spawn one pin per table once the first report→order loop completes.
3. **Level 2:** Fill officer seats in cardinal order (north → east → south → west).
4. **Level 3+:** Evolve pins into sparks, wits, or doctrine glyphs as mission load increases.

Each resolved deliberation increments capacity, producing visual growth instead of manual bookkeeping.

### Movement Rules

- Officers moving between seats swap glyphs with the floor symbol they vacate.
- Pins migrate through table centers; escalation to another table archives their prior cell.
- Floor glyphs persist as the default empty state, making occupation changes obvious in the grid.

## 📐 Scale Key

Scale Key: 1 cell ≈ 1 decision node; 4×4 cells ≈ 1 War-Table; color gradient = entropy index.

## 🌈 Field Maxim

> Field Maxim: Map the light, discipline the debate, and let every order leave the room sharper than it entered.
