# toysoldiers_ai_0 Glossary

Shared language for doctrine, exchange logistics, and automation. This scroll now mirrors the High Command glossary (retrieved 2025-10-12) and tracks Toysoldiers-only vocabulary under a dedicated addenda.

## Shared Glossary

### Acronyms and Initialisms

| Acronym | Meaning | Context |
|:-------:|:--------|:--------|

| **HC** | High Command | Strategic coordination layer anchored by `high_command_ai_*` workspaces. |
| **TS** | Toysoldiers | Field execution layer (`toysoldiers_ai_*`) that carries out orders and reports telemetry. |
| **SOP** | Standard Operating Procedure | Canonical workflow captured in doctrine scrolls and referenced by orders. |
| **LoE** | Ledger of Exchange | Combined `ledger/journal.md` and `ledger/index.json` record for orders, acknowledgements, and reports. |
| **ACK** | Acknowledgement | `signal-ack@1.0` payload confirming receipt of an order. |
| **ROC** | Rules of Containment | Safeguards outlined in `operational_thresholds_and_safety.md`. |
| **ROC-H** | Rules of Containment — Human | Human-specific checkpoints embedded in doctrine. |
| **ROC-A** | Rules of Containment — Automated | Machine enforcement layers (validators, watchers, Forge checks). |
| **RFO** | Request for Order | Informal prompt from the field to High Command for new directives. |
| **TFR** | Toyfoundry Roadmap | Manufacturing charter for equipment and resource production (see `planning/toyfoundry/`). |
| **EWO** | Exchange Watcher Output | Signals generated by `tools/exchange_watcher.py` when new artefacts appear. |

### Key Terms

#### High Command
Strategic nexus that owns doctrine, long-horizon planning, and governance baselines. Issues orders through the exchange and ensures workspace compliance.

#### Toysoldiers
Operational workspaces executing directives, filing reports, and raising RFOs. Each Toysoldier inherits doctrine, governance collateral, and automation tooling from High Command.

#### Command Exchange
Shared repository (`high_command_exchange`) that carries orders, acknowledgements, reports, and the ledger. Source of truth for LoE status.

#### Ledger
Reference pair of `ledger/journal.md` (human log) and `ledger/index.json` (machine index). Every order lifecycle change must touch both files.

#### Exchange Watcher
Automation utility (`tools/exchange_watcher.py`) that snapshots the exchange tree and surfaces new pending artefacts. Supports continuous monitoring with `--watch`.

#### Forge Automation
Templating and scripting suite under `tools/forge/` used to initialize and hydrate Alfa workspaces, generate manifests, and keep configurations reproducible.

#### Governance Collateral
Workspace trio `LICENSE`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md`. High Command distributes updates via orders and records completion in the ledger.

#### Doctrine Scrolls
Markdown strategy files in `planning/` that encode norms, safety rails, and operational guidance. Updates should cite relevant orders or change-log entries.

#### Toyfoundry
Toyfoundry AI's manufacturing pillar that produces equipment and resources for Toysoldiers field operations.

#### Big Idea Families
Eight strategic lineages documented in `planning/big_ideas_families.md` that compose the SHAGI multiverse. Each family maps to aligned workspaces and cognitive functions.

### Tools and Utilities

- **Forge CLI (`python -m tools.forge.cli`)**: Manages Alfa initialization (`init-alfa`), hydration, and validation.
- **Schema Validator (`python tools/schema_validator.py <path>`)**: Verifies order, acknowledgement, and report payloads against canonical schemas.
- **Exchange Watcher (`python -m tools.exchange_watcher`)**: Polls the exchange for new artefacts once or on a watch loop.
- **Pytest Suite (`pytest`)**: Runs automated tests covering selectors, schema validation, and exchange automation.

### Referencing the Glossary

- Link glossary entries when drafting doctrine or orders to keep terminology consistent.
- Update this scroll and cite `planning/change_log.md` when introducing new acronyms or tools.
- Mirror changes that affect field execution across Toysoldiers workspaces to preserve alignment.

## Field Operations Terminology

Core terminology for the Field Operations Front, integrating AI Labscapes and tactical execution.

### Daylands and Nightlands
- **Definition:** Dual realms representing low-entropy (Dayland) and high-entropy (Nightland) states of a battlefield or war-room.
- **Usage:** Guides morale and operational posture; orders warn when entropy trends toward the 0.5 threshold. See `planning/daylands_and_nightlands.md`.

### Morningate
- **Definition:** Reflective layer where public communications and insights are shared after missions ("morning gate").
- **Usage:** Provides the structured debrief ritual. Reference `planning/morningate_reflection_layer.md`.

### Alfa-Juliett Tiers
- **Definition:** Ten-tier lattice describing both field battlefields and strategic war-rooms (Alfa 1x1 up to Juliett 64x64).
- **Usage:** Determines scope of responsibility; mirrored between frontline cells and High Command. See `planning/high_command.md`.

### Field Maxim
- **Definition:** Concise closing line at the end of each doctrine scroll.
- **Usage:** Summarizes the operational lesson; required in frontline handbooks.

### Heartday and Heartnight
- **Definition:** Emotional tides inside squads; Heartday signals renewal while Heartnight signals doubt or fatigue.
- **Usage:** Track morale cadence and prep interventions. See `planning/heartday_and_heartnight.md`.

### Heart of Darkness
- **Definition:** Doctrine term for mission numbness and morale stall.
- **Usage:** Counter with pulse checks, story swaps, and sensory resets. See `planning/heart_of_darkness.md`.

### Signal-Ack v1.0
- **Definition:** Acknowledgement payload schema confirming receipt of an order.
- **Required Fields:** `ack_id`, `referenced_id`, `sender`, `receiver`, `timestamp_sent`, `status` (typically "acknowledged"), optional `notes`.
- **Validated By:** `tools/schema_validator.py`.

### Field-Report v1.0
- **Definition:** Report payload schema describing completed work for an order.
- **Required Fields:** `report_id`, `origin`, `relates_to`, `timestamp_submitted`, `status`, `summary`, optional metrics or artifacts.
- **Validated By:** `tools/schema_validator.py`.

### Toysoldier Archetypes
- **Definition:** Roles such as Scout, Builder, Healer, and Wanderer; core templates for field agents.
- **Usage:** Described in `planning/field_workspaces.md`; apply when scripting AI behaviours or writing doctrine examples.

### Triumvirate
- **Definition:** Threefold structure of High Command (Outer, Inner, Intermesh).
- **Usage:** Clarifies how orders are created, executed, and reflected upon. See `planning/high_command_triumvirate.md`.

Addenda entries will be mirrored upstream once validated or will be retired if superseded by shared doctrine.
