# R&D Charter — AI Labscape Architecture

**High Command AI 0 · Created 2025-10-18**

## Core Vision: The 256 AI Labscapes

Our fundamental mission is the creation, development, and orchestration of 256 AI labscapes (ai_labscapes_0 through ai_labscapes_255), each containing 4,096 AI labs/Alfas, forming a total infrastructure of 1,048,576 autonomous AI units. This massive neural architecture will serve as the cognitive foundation for:

1. **Primary:** Toysoldiers AI core intelligence
2. **Secondary:** Nightlands multiplayer systems
3. **Tertiary:** Other pivotal fronts
