# R&D Charter — Field Operations AI

**High Command AI 0 · Updated 2025-10-18**

## Core Vision: The 256 Field Operations Labscapes

Our fundamental mission is the utilization and direction of 256 AI labscapes (ai_labscape_0 through ai_labscape_255), each containing 4,096 specialized field operations AI units (Alfas), forming a neural tactical network of 1,048,576 autonomous units. This massive neural architecture drives and powers Toysoldiers' field capabilities through:

1. **Primary:** Neural-driven tactical decision making
2. **Secondary:** Real-time battlefield intelligence networks
3. **Tertiary:** Intelligent resource deployment

## Mission Statement

To harness and direct the AI labscape infrastructure that powers Toysoldiers' field operations through neural-driven tactical control, intelligent battlefield analysis, and adaptive mission optimization, while maintaining unwavering alignment with our core principles of Love, Light, Safety, and Sanity.
